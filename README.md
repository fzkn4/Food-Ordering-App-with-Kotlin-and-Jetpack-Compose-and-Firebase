# Grab 'n Eat
#### I developed an online ordering app using `Kotlin` and `Jetpack Compose` for the Android frontend, integrated with `Firebase` as the backend database. The app allows users to browse a dynamic menu, place orders seamlessly, and receive real-time updatesâ€”all within a modern, responsive UI built with Compose. Firebase handles user authentication, order storage, and live data sync, ensuring a smooth and scalable experience.
